## Week 1 - History
- Writing first happened ~5,000 years ago on clay tablets in Mesopotamia
- Cuneiform is wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay
- The Gutenberg Press introduced metal moveable type, revolutionized printing
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- A Byte is a group of 8 bits (binary digits, base 2)
- Volatile memory loses its data when power is off (RAM)
- Non-Volatile memory retains data when power is off (storage devices, SSD)
- ASCII table maps specific numbers to specific characters
- Text files are interpreted as characters using ASCII, while binary files aren't intended to be read as text
- Morse Code is historic binary use, neat.
- Decimal is base 10, Binary is base 2, Hexadecimal is base 16
## Week 3 - Structure of Text
- Markup Languages
    - Markdown is a markup language with simple syntax for formatting, examples include: \# Title, \_italic_ , \- list item
    - HTML, HyperText Markup Language, is more complicated and uses tags, examples include: &lt;p&gt; (paragraph) and &lt;ul&gt; (unordered list)
    - Special characters are non-alphanumeric symbols with specific purposes in specific languages. "Escaping" lets us see these characters. \ in Markdown, and character entities in HTML (such as \&lt; for &lt;)
- Structured Data
    - JSON is human-readable, format {"key":"value"}
    - XML, Extensible Markup Language, similar to HTML, represents data, uses tags: &lt;tag&gt;value&lt;/tag&gt;
- Unicode is like ASCII but has larger numbers and more characters. UTF-8 is the most popular
## Week 4 - Keyboards and Editors
- QWERTY is the most common (to me, at least) keyboard layout. AZERTY and Dvorak also exist.
- Modifier keys allow certain keys to do different things, e.g., holding the SHIFT key can turn a into A
- Text Editors are simple like Notepad, Word Processors are in-depth like Microsoft Word.
        - Popular text editors include: VIM (with edit command :q!), VSCode.
- IDEs, Integrated development environments, let you do a lot of stuff, example is WebStorm
- For searching, CTRL+F lets you find text. \* is a wildcard for any character sequence. Regex (regular expressions) allow for pattern matching.
- GitHub pages host web pages (like this one!)
## Week 5 - CLI
- Command Line Interfaces (CLI), came from teletype machines that printed on paper, later on screens. Commands were short.
- CLI can be faster for some things than GUIs, automating through scripting, low-bandwidth remote capability.
- Lots of navigation and file management commands such as: "ls" for listing directory files, \"-a" after "ls" listing all entries for files (including hidden things), "cat" for displaying file contents. Commmands can be combined!
- Secure Shell (SSH) lets you securely connect to computers remotely, command line access.
- File Transfer Protocols
        - scp: securely copy files
        - sftp: secure file transfer protocol
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets you run Linux within Windows
